			<h3> About Me </h3>	
				<p> 
					I began wildlife photography in 2025 and instantly fell in love with it.   
					I love all animals and dream of traveling the world to photograph them in 
					their natural habitat. Not only does it bring me joy, but I hope my photos
					inspire others to care more about wildlife conservation. Humans are the most significant agent of ecological change! 
					Nature has been around before us, yet we behave as if it revolves around us
					It is time to make a change! 
				</p>

					<p>"Look closely at nature. Every species is a masterpiece, exquisitely adapted 
						to the particular environment in which it has survived. Who are we to destroy 
						or even diminish biodiversity?
						E.O. Wilson"
