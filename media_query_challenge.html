    <h1>Media Query Challenge</h1>
    <p> Here is my paragraph element. I really want a Nikon Z8
        and a job in web development. I am however, nervous since
        it is a completely new field for me and is very competitive.
        I find it challenging to code without google. Hopefully, 
        this will all click soon.  I am sure with practice I will
        get better at coding!
