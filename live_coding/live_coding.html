                        Grace Hopper was a pioneering American computer scientist and U.S. Navy Rear Admiral whose
                        revolutionary impact reshaped the future of technology. She invented the first compiler and
                        co-developed COBOL, a programming language that allowed people to write commands in English-like
                        code instead of machine language — making computers more accessible to the world. Her work
                        simplified programming, expanded the reach of computing, and laid the foundation for modern
                        software development. A fierce advocate for machine-independent languages, Hopper received
                        numerous honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and remains an iconic figure whose
                        legacy continues to inspire generations of women in tech.

                <h3> Early Life and Education</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
                Grace Hopper was a pioneering American computer scientist and U.S. Navy Rear Admiral whose revolutionary
                impact reshaped the future of technology. Born Grace Brewster Murray in New York City on December 9,
                1906, she grew up in a household that encouraged intellectual curiosity and independence. Her father
                believed in equal education for his daughters, and her mother, who had studied geometry, nurtured
                Grace’s love of mathematics. As a child, she famously dismantled alarm clocks to understand how they
                worked — a sign of the curiosity that would define her career.

                Hopper earned her bachelor’s degree in mathematics and physics from Vassar College in 1928, graduating
                Phi Beta Kappa. She went on to receive a master’s degree in mathematics from Yale University in 1930 and
                completed her PhD in mathematics there in 1934 — a rare achievement for women at the time. While
                pursuing her doctorate, she taught mathematics at Vassar, blending academic rigor with mentorship.

                Her contributions to computer science were groundbreaking. Hopper invented the first compiler, a tool
                that translated human-readable code into machine language, and co-developed COBOL, a programming
                language that allowed programmers to write commands in English-like syntax. This innovation made
                computers more accessible and broadened their user base, laying the foundation for modern software
                development. She was also a fierce advocate for machine-independent programming languages, which helped
                standardize computing across platforms.

                Throughout her career, Hopper received numerous awards and honors, including the Presidential Medal of
                Freedom. She remains an iconic figure in computing history, celebrated not only for her technical
                achievements but also for her visionary leadership and mentorship. Her legacy continues to inspire
                generations of women in technology and serves as a reminder that curiosity, courage, and clarity can
                change the world.

        <div class="info_tile">

                <h3>World War II & Navy Career</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
                In 1943, Hopper enlisted in the U.S. Navy Reserve at age 37, despite being over the age limit and under
                the required weight. She was determined to serve and was accepted due to her exceptional academic
                background. After graduating from Midshipman’s School in 1944, she was assigned to Harvard University’s
                Cruft Laboratory, where she worked on the Harvard Mark I, one of the earliest electromechanical
                computers.
                Hopper became one of the first programmers of the Mark I, contributing to its programming manual and
                helping the Navy perform complex wartime calculations. Her work during WWII laid the foundation for her
                lifelong career in computing and military service.


                After the war, Hopper remained in the Navy Reserve and joined the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation,
                where she worked on the UNIVAC I, the first commercial computer. In 1952, she developed the first
                compiler, a tool that translated human-readable instructions into machine code — a revolutionary concept
                at the time.
                She later led the development of FLOW-MATIC, the first English-like programming language, which directly
                influenced the creation of COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language). COBOL became one of the most
                widely used programming languages in business and government, and it’s still in use today.


                Hopper’s military career continued alongside her civilian work. She was recalled to active duty multiple
                times and eventually became the oldest active-duty officer in the U.S. Navy, retiring in 1986 at age 79
                with the rank of Rear Admiral (lower half). She was affectionately nicknamed “Amazing Grace” for her
                brilliance and tenacity.
                She received numerous honors, including:
                - Presidential Medal of Freedom (posthumously awarded in 2016)
                - Defense Distinguished Service Medal
                - Legion of Merit
                - More than 40 honorary degrees
                Her legacy lives on through the USS Hopper, the Hopper supercomputer, and the annual Grace Hopper
                Celebration of Women in Computing, which empowers women in tech worldwide.

                <h3>Retirement</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
                After retiring as a Rear Admiral (lower half), Hopper transitioned into civilian life with the same
                energy and purpose that defined her military service. She became a senior consultant at Digital
                Equipment Corporation, where she continued to advocate for innovation in computing and mentored young
                engineers. Known for her engaging lectures and visual teaching aids — like her famous “nanosecond wires”
                — she traveled widely, inspiring audiences with her wit, clarity, and vision.
                Even in retirement, Hopper remained a powerful voice in tech, pushing for user-friendly programming and
                machine-independent languages. She received numerous accolades, including over 40 honorary degrees and
                the National Medal of Technology. In 1992, she passed away at age 85 and was buried with full military
                honors at Arlington National Cemetery.
                Her legacy lives on through the USS Hopper, the Hopper supercomputer, and the annual Grace Hopper
                Celebration of Women in Computing, which continues to empower and connect women in tech around the
                world.
