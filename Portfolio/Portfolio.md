**Portfolio**



### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step: See Your Website Live on GitHub

#### 1. **Make sure your main file is named `index.html`**
GitHub Pages looks for `index.html` in the root of your repository.

#### 2. **Go to your GitHub repo**
Example:  
`https://github.com/alisonliguori/portfolio-site`

#### 3. **Click on the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù tab** (top right of the repo)

#### 4. Scroll down to **‚ÄúPages‚Äù** (in the left sidebar or under ‚ÄúCode and automation‚Äù)

#### 5. Under **‚ÄúSource‚Äù**, choose:
- Branch: `main`
- Folder: `/ (root)`

Then click **Save**.

#### 6. GitHub will generate a link like:
```
https://alisonliguori.github.io/portfolio-site/
```

That‚Äôs your **live website**. Bookmark it, share it, flaunt it.


### üß† Pro Tip
If you don‚Äôt see the ‚ÄúPages‚Äù section, make sure:
- You‚Äôre in the **repo settings**, not your account settings
- Your repo is **public** (private repos don‚Äôt work with GitHub Pages unless you upgrade)

**FINAL ASSIGNMENT**
You have reached the final assignment on this course and it‚Äôs a big one! On it, you will be creating a full website with its own URL. In addition to writing code, 
you will push your website from your machine to live on the internet.The website you are creating will be a portfolio site. A portfolio website provides an online 
description of you and what you can do. It typically includes past projects and can be a great tool to landing a job. Your portfolio site will link to your GitHub account.
Portfolio websites are very useful in landing development work. Even if you aren‚Äôt looking to secure employment in development upon completion of your training, the experience 
of creating a full website from scratch and putting it on the world wide web is essential for developers. This will be a basic website that you will upgrade several times later 
on your bootcamp. At this point, it will be a simple HTML and CSS website. For example: you will add to it on the JavaScript Course (and others).

CREATING YOUR PORTFOLIO WEBSITE ASSIGNMENT
Using the provided templates (https://htmlandcssportfolio.com/, ‚Äúindex.html‚Äù and ‚Äúportfolio.css‚Äù) as a guide, create your portfolio site.
You should type all of this code from scratch yourself instead of copying and pasting. This will give you a better idea of what each line of code does exactly, and provide you with more experience.
It is recommended that you keep the basic layout provided.

You are allowed to keep some of the styling (background colors, fonts, etc.) for your site but are required to customize (personalize) at least one element of the site. Here are some example customizations:
Font,Colors,Video,Hover effects, etc. Ensure that the content (i.e., text contained within the Home, About and GitHub sections) is customized and reflects what you want to say about yourself.
It is highly recommended that you save and run your code often. Factually, you should test your code after adding each element and each CSS class/ID. That way you can instantly spot issues in your code and so more easily isolate the source of problems.


**LIVE WEBSITE OPTIONS ASSIGNMENT**  
Well done on creating your portfolio website!  
You will now move your website from your computer to the internet to a live site where it can be viewed by other people.  
In order to place the website online at a URL of your choosing, you will need to purchase two things:  
A domain name (for example: yourname.com). This costs a yearly fee.  
Hosting (a service where you ‚Äúrent‚Äù servers from a company to store and serve up your files). This can be purchased on a monthly or annual subscription.  
We will be using the web hosting and domain company called GoDaddy.  
The cost to purchase hosting and a domain name for a year can cost around $100.  
The other option (which is free) is using GitHub to store your website. If you use GitHub to host your site, the URL will be https://username.github.io, not a domain name of your choosing.  
The downsides to using GitHub for your website include missing out on the following experiences (meaning, you will not participate in these areas if you use GitHub):  
- Obtaining a domain name.  
- Utilizing a hosting service.  
- Putting FTP into use on a real project.  
Basically, while doing it through GitHub costs nothing, you will not gain the experience of putting a website up on the internet as it‚Äôs done by most companies and working developers.  
With that said, if you prefer to utilize the free option of publishing your website on GitHub (which is totally acceptable), please study this page in full and perform all of the steps covered at this link with your website now:  
**GitHub Pages | Websites for You**  
If you end up publishing your website on GitHub, you can skip the steps on this assignment that relate to GoDaddy. Otherwise, please continue.


**GODADDY ASSIGNMENT**

Check over the previous course steps to ensure you followed all instructions exactly.


In GitHub, create a new repository named ‚ÄúPortfolio‚Äù, this is where you will be pushing your code.  You will be adding on to your portfolio throughout your bootcamp, so it is important to have it saved in your GitHub account.

The website you made does not display properly across all devices ‚Äì i.e., it was made to display on computers and laptops (not mobile devices). Therefore, if you view it on your phone, it won‚Äôt display properly.


You will be fixing this on the JavaScript Course because there is more knowledge required to do so.
