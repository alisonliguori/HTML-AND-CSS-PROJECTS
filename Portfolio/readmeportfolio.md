## HTML & CSS Projects

My portfolio showcases sample websites I created during my coursework at the Tech Academy. Each project reflects my evolving skills in layout, styling, and user experience.

### üç≥ Simple Recipes *(my favorite)*  
A playful and expressive recipe website styled with CSS. It includes interactive flip cards for featured dishes and a contact form for users. This project deepened my love for web design and taught me how to balance creativity with clarity.

### üêæ The Pet Shop (adopt don't shop)  
A vibrant landing page for a fictional pet store. Styled with CSS, it incorporates embedded video and visuals of the coolest (and cutest) pets. This project showcases my ability to blend multimedia elements with accessible layout design.
